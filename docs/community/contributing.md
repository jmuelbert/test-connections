Thank you for being interested in contributing to checkconnect.

## Reporting Bugs or Other Issues

Found something that checkconnect should support?
Stumbled upon some unexpected behaviour?

Contributions should generally start out with [a discussion](https://github.com/jmuelbert/checkconnect/discussions).
Possible bugs may be raised as a "Potential Issue" discussion, feature requests may
be raised as an "Ideas" discussion. We can then determine if the discussion needs
to be escalated into an "Issue" or not, or if we'd consider a pull request.

Try to be more descriptive as you can and in case of a bug report,
provide as much information as possible like:

- OS platform
- Python version
- Installed dependencies and versions (`python -m pip freeze`)
- Code snippet
- Error traceback

You should always try to reduce any examples to the _simplest possible case_
that demonstrates the issue.

The usual process to make a contribution is to:

1. Check for existing related issues
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch
1. Make your changes
1. Make sure formatting, linting and tests passes.
1. Add tests if possible to cover the lines you added.
1. Commit, and send a Pull Request.
