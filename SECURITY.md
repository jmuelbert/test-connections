# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment checkconnect only considers the very latest commit to be
supported. We combine that with our fast response to incidents and the automated
updates to minimize the time between vulnerability publication and patch
release.

| Version       | Supported          |
| :------------ | :----------------- |
| master        | :white_check_mark: |
| other commits | :x:                |

In the near future we will introduce versioning, so expect this section to
change.
